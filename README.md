### **📌 Assignment 2: Spam Classifier from Scratch**  
**Dataset:** 5172 labeled emails (spam or not spam)  
**Key Focus:**  
- Implement a **binary classification model** from scratch  
- Feature extraction & preprocessing  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall  
- **Constraints:** Only inbuilt libraries for plotting, strict plagiarism rules  

**Files:**  
- `SpamHamCV.ipynb` – Trains the classification model  
- `NB_classifier_test_code.ipynb` – Used for testing the model, also evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
- `compressed_data.csv.zip/emails.csv` – The dataset used  
- `Report.pdf` – Implementation details, results, and analysis  

#### **🔧 Testing Instructions**  
To test the classifier, follow these steps:  

1. **Save all files** inside the `Assignment_2_Spam_Classifier/` folder.  
2. Download the **Test folder** from the given link below (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iPblBBvL2H5q5xVxpIcwD6rQjEFqViGm?usp=sharing).  
3. Alternatively, manually **create a folder named "Test"** inside `Assignment_2_Spam_Classifier/` and **add all your test emails in `.txt` format** to run the code successfully.  
4. Run the classifier to check the predictions.
